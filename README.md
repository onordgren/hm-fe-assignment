# WORK TASK #

**Please read this document thoroughly** and plan your work accordingly.
When ready, create a new repository and do your implementation there.

This work task is divided into two parts:
### 1: CSS-wizardry ###
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmfe/54321/master/button.png)

Recreate this button using only HTML/CSS and using as few HTML-elements as
possible. (HINT: It is possible to solve this using only one `<button>`)

* You can provide a solution for this separately or as a part of the solution for (2)
### 2: Implement a simple search application ###

Implement a simple search application. The search should use a public REST API of your
choice using JavaScript.

- Search for title, return title (or something like that)
- Display partial search results in a list beneath the search field (auto complete)
- Display the selected results in an editable list beneath the search component 

  * Selected search result should be saved with date/time stamp (as a
search history)
  * User should be able to delete a result from the list or delete the entire
list

- The application should be responsive, adapting to changes of the viewport

### What we will look at: ###

- HTML5: Semantic markup, SEO optimization, accessibility
   * Use HTML5 and show us that you have deep knowledge of semantic
markup

- CSS3: Responsivity, use of pseudo elements, HTML entities and complexity
of solution
  * Surprise us with interesting solutions and show off your skills!
  * NOTE: Solution based on premade CSS frameworks will be completely discarded

- JS: complexity, sanity, comments and security
  * The search should fetch data for each entry, don’t store a complete
database response in a variable and iterate through that
  * Sanitize your inputs and don’t stress the API more than necessary

- General sanity check on structure and solution
  * Show to us that you know - how front-end development should be
done

When done, push your code and send us a link to your repository.

**Good Luck and have fun!**
